# Crude_Oil_Price_Model
Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in the world economy, and its price can have a significant impact on various industries and sectors. However, predicting crude oil prices can be challenging due to various factors such as geopolitical events, supply and demand fluctuations, and global economic conditions.

To address this challenge, we aim to build a machine learning model that can effectively forecast crude oil prices. We will be using various algorithms such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, as well as economic indicators such as GDP, inflation rates, and oil inventories. By combining these algorithms and indicators, we hope to create a model that can accurately predict crude oil prices.

We will be using data from various sources such as FRED, EIA, and Quandl to train and test our model. Our ultimate goal is to create a model that can provide insights and value for traders, investors, and anyone interested in the crude oil market.
