# Crude_Oil_Price_Model
Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in the world economy, and its price can have a significant impact on various industries and sectors. However, predicting crude oil prices can be challenging due to various factors such as geopolitical events, supply and demand fluctuations, and global economic conditions.

To address this challenge, we aim to build a machine learning model that can effectively forecast crude oil prices. We will be using various algorithms such as ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
